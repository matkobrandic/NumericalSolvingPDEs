# NumericalSolvingPDEs
These are the projects that I have made for the two-semester course of the same name, offered by PMF Zagreb.

The projects were written in C++ using [Dune](https://www.dune-project.org/).
Final project for the course can be found in my other Repo named [plane-elasticity](https://github.com/matkobrandic/plane-elasticity).
